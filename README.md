Problem Statement: 1
In many communities, people possess valuable skills but lack access to services they can’t afford. This platform empowers users to exchange skills directly — for example:

A developer can teach coding in exchange for guitar lessons

A chef can offer cooking classes in return for graphic design help

A digital marketer can get language tutoring by mentoring someone in social media

This fosters community learning, knowledge sharing, and non-monetary collaboration.
